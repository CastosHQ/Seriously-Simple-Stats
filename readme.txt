== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of Seriously Simple Podcasting does this plugin require? =

In order to use this plugin you need to have at least v1.13.1 of Seriously Simple Podcasting. If you do not have Seriously Simple Podcasting active or you are using a version older than v1.13.1 then this plugin will do nothing.

= I just installed this plugin, but I don't see any stats. What gives? =

Your podcast stats will only be gathered while this plugin is active, so if you have just installed it wait a few days and you will start to see your stats growing.

= What listening sources are tracked? =

Seriously Simple Stats tracks the following listening sources for your podcast:

- iTunes / iOS Podcasts
- Overcast
- Pocket Casts
- Direct downloads
- Audio player listens
- 'Play in new window' clicks

Any other listening sources will simply appear grouped as 'Other' in your stats. If there is another service that you think would be valuable to have tracked, then please [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/Seriously-Simple-Stats/issues/new) to suggest it.

Note that Stitcher download stats are not currently possible to gather accurately due to the way that Stitcher offers up episode downloads to users.

= Does this plugin block crawlers or bots? =

Yes. This plugin uses the [Crawler Detect](https://github.com/JayBizzle/Crawler-Detect) library to make sure that crawlers/bots are not recorded as listens.
